Data structure: Domain

plan/ scheme/ blue print/ guidlines: how to organize data

but data can be anything

Process/ Steps:

Requirement analysis
background knowledge about scheme/ structure

Algorithm	>> human understandable steps/instruction about how 			implementation would be done

implementation	>> programming language to implement the algorithm
			choose an language based on high performance and need
			

Structures:
Array
Stack
LinkedList
Queue
Vector
Tree
Graph


Operations:
Create 
Read 
Update 
Delete 
List
Search
Sort

Approaches/ Algorithms: performance
analysis: time and space
notations:
Omega, Theta, 

Big Oho >> worst case analysis notation
O(1)
O(n)
O(n2)
O(logn)
O(nlogn)
O(n3)........

Implentation:
static memory	: fixed memory: arary
dynamic memory	: memory adjustable: collections>> java.util
